# tic-tac-toe
A simple tic-tac-toe game built with Bootstrap, Browserify and JQuery.

### Intention
The ideia of this project came from a college project, during the Software Engineer course.
I decided to use some frameworks such as Bootstrap and GreenSock JS to work together and produce a simple and nice animated game.
